Howdy, Gacel here.
So this files are what controls the info in the Ikemen GO's exe.
Like the icon or the version number.

You can edit them with any text edtior. (Ikemen_GO.exe.manifest and Ikemen_GO.rc)
You can edit the Icon with Gimp and Photoshop, paint and paint.net do not fully support them.
Maybe there are more image editor that support them if you know one, please inform me.

To create a syso file you need Windres (If you have MinGW/MinGW64 you have Windres)
To create a new syso file use:

windres -o ikemen_go.syso Ikemen_GO.rc

If you are in a 64 bit os and you want to create a x86 syso you can use:

windres -o ikemen_go_x86.syso Ikemen_GO.rc --output-format=coff --target=pe-i386

And that's all =)
Hope you have a nice day!
